# Example authz file for DSvn authorization
#
# This file follows Apache Subversion authz.conf format
# See: https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html
#
# Format:
# [groups]
# group_name = user1, user2, user3
#
# [repository_path]
# user_or_group = r|rw| (empty for no access)
#
# Special characters:
# * = anonymous users (no authentication)
# @group_name = group reference

[groups]
# Define user groups
developers = alice, bob, charlie
admins = admin, dave
readers = eve, frank

# Repository root access rules
[/]
# Anonymous users can read (no authentication required)
* = r

# Admins have full access
@admins = rw

# Developers can read/write
@developers = rw

# Readers can only read
@readers = r

# Specific user rules (overrides group rules)
alice = rw  # Alice has full access
bob = r     # Bob can only read (overrides developers group)

# Private directory rules
[/private]
# Only admins can access private directory
@admins = rw
* =        # Deny all others (empty means no access)

# Source code directory
[/trunk/src]
# Developers can read/write source code
@developers = rw

# Everyone else can read
* = r

# Documentation directory
[/trunk/docs]
# Everyone can read documentation
* = r

# Only admins can write documentation

# Branch-specific rules
[/branches/experimental]
# Only specific developers can access experimental branches
alice = rw

# Tag directory (read-only for all)
[/tags]

# User-specific directories
[/users/alice]

[/users/bob]
bob = rw
* = r

# Path with wildcard (not standard SVN, but DSvn supports)
[/trunk/src/*/tests]
# Everyone can read tests
* = r

# Only developers can write tests

# Complex path example
[/trunk/src/project/module]
# Module maintainers have full access
charlie = rw
dave = rw

# Others can read
* = r

# Deny access to sensitive files
[/trunk/src/config/secrets]
# Only admins can access secrets
@admins = rw
* =        # Deny all others

# Example for multiple repositories (when using multi-repo mode)
[repo1:/]
* = r
@admins = rw

[repo2:/]
@developers = rw
* = r

# Notes:
# 1. Rules are evaluated from most specific to least specific path
# 2. User-specific rules override group rules
# 3. Later rules for the same path/user override earlier ones
# 4. Empty access string ("") means no access
# 5. Use "r" for read-only access
# 6. Use "rw" for read-write access
# 7. Group names must be defined in [groups] section
